        MovableMixin is a mixin class that provides functionality for agents that need to move along a defined path

            path (list): A list of coordinates that represents the path the vehicle should follow.
            chunked_path (list): A list of smaller steps or 'chunks' of the path based on the speed of the vehicle.
            animation_speed (int): The time in milliseconds between steps in the animation or movement process.
            speed_in_kmh (float): The current speed of the vehicle in kilometers per hour.
            dest (list): The destination coordinates (longitude, latitude) of the vehicle.
            distances (list): A list of distances traveled.
